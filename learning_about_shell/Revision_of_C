In the beginning, there were 0's and 1's.

A byte is the smallest unit that can be addressed by a CPU.

I revised the:
$$$ memory structure of the computer and the uses.
- The stack: Declaration of variables.
- The Heap: Allocation of memory and used during runtime.
- The BSS: Uninitialized global variables.
- The Data: Initialized global variables.
- Text: Intructions the program run(Read only and executable).

$$$ Compilation steps
- Preprocessing: Handles comment, macros
- Compiling: Converts the code to assembly code
- Assembling: Converts the code to object code
- Linking: Linking libraries in the code

$$$ variables
- Data types:int, float, double, char
- Size of data types
- padding
- Writing and compiling a simple program

$$$ Pointers and memory allocation
- Pointers: A variable that contains address of variables(char *ptr->a char pointer).
- Array: contain variables of the same data type.
- Relationship between array and pointers.
- Pointers Arithmetic.
- Dereferencing a pointer: * the derefrence operator(*ptr)
- Memory allocation: Using malloc, calloc and realloc.
- Memory deallocation: Using free.
- Multidimensonal arrays: Indexing multidimensional arrays using array syntax and pointer syntax.

$$$ Memory Allocation Errors
- Memory Leaks: Objects in memory that are no longer in use but that are freed.
- Premature Free: Objects that is still in use by the program is freed.
- Double Free: Freeing an object that is already free.
- Wild Frees: Attempts to free a pointer in memory that was not returned by malloc.
- Memory Smashing: Less memory is allocated than the amount of memory requested.
- Use Valgrind to debug memory allocation errors

$$$ GDB tool
- Installed gdb tool and used it on a test case.
- Learnt the various commands related to the GDB tool(r -> run, b -> break, l -> list etc)
